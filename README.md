# DispatchHost
 if your dispatch in ps is horrible, this is a temporary solution

# Usage
- bring your Gateserver.proto ([example from LunarCore](https://gitlab.com/Melledy/LunarCore-Protos/-/blob/main/proto/Gateserver.proto)) to the root folder
- bring your hotfix.json (you can get one using [FetchHotfix](https://github.com/Hiro420/FetchHotfix))
- `npm i` to install all dependencies
- `npm run start`

# NOT USEFUL FOR LUNARCORE, BUT FOR OTHER PS THAT SEPARATE DISPATCH FROM PS ITSELF
